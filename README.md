## Setup and Usage

To run this project locally, follow these simple steps:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```sh
    git clone https://github.com/sv-reddy/Weather-WebApp.git
    ```

2.  **Get an API Key:**
    * Go to [OpenWeatherMap](https://openweathermap.org/api) and create a free account.
    * Navigate to the "API keys" tab to find your unique API key.

3.  **Add the API Key to the project:**
    * Open the `script.js` file.
    * Find the line with the `apiKey` variable.
    * Replace `'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'` with the key you obtained from OpenWeatherMap.

    ```javascript
    // In script.js
    const apiKey = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'; // Replace with YOUR valid API key
    ```
    > **‚ö†Ô∏è Important:** It is best practice not to commit your API key directly into a public repository. For personal projects, this is acceptable, but for larger applications, consider using environment variables.

4.  **Open in Browser:**
    * Simply open the `index.html` file in your web browser.
    * You can now enter a city name and get the weather!

    * Uses an `async` function `fetchWeatherData` to make an API call to OpenWeatherMap.
    * Parses the JSON response and updates the DOM to display the weather information.
    * Includes a helper function `getWeatherEmoji` to select the correct emoji based on the weather type.
